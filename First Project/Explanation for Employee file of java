## 1. Import Statements:
import java.sql.*;
import java.util.Scanner;

- **Explanation:** 
  - These statements import necessary Java classes for database connectivity (`java.sql.*`) and user input (`java.util.Scanner`).

### 2. Class Declaration:
public class Employee {
    // Class implementation
}

- **Explanation:** 
  - The `Employee` class encapsulates the functionality of the program.

### 3. Member Variables:
private static final Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

- **Explanation:** 
  - This line declares a `Scanner` object for user input as a static member variable, ensuring only one instance is shared across all instances of the class.

### 4. Method: `showData`
public static void showData(Statement stmt) {
    // Method implementation
}

- **Explanation:** 
  - This method displays employee data retrieved from the "employee" table in the connected database.
  - It takes a `Statement` object (`stmt`) as a parameter, representing the database connection.

### 5. Method: `insertData`
public static void insertData(Statement stmt) {
    // Method implementation
}

- **Explanation:** 
  - This method prompts the user for employee details and inserts a new record into the "employee" table.
  - It takes a `Statement` object (`stmt`) as a parameter, representing the database connection.

### 6. Method: `deleteData`
public static void deleteData(Statement stmt) {
    // Method implementation
}

- **Explanation:** 
  - This method prompts the user for an employee ID and deletes the corresponding record from the "employee" table.
  - It takes a `Statement` object (`stmt`) as a parameter, representing the database connection.

### 7. Method: `updateData`
public static void updateData(Statement stmt) {
    // Method implementation
}

- **Explanation:** 
  - This method prompts the user for an employee ID, increments it, and updates the corresponding record in the "employee" table.
  - It takes a `Statement` object (`stmt`) as a parameter, representing the database connection.

### 8. Method: `main`
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Main method implementation
}

- **Explanation:** 
  - The `main` method is the entry point of the program.
  - It prompts the user for database connection details, establishes a connection, creates a `Statement` object, and performs various database operations.

### 9. JDBC Driver Loading:
Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");

- **Explanation:** 
  - This line dynamically loads the MySQL JDBC driver (`com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver`) into the memory.

### 10. Database Connection:
Connection con1 = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);

- **Explanation:** 
  - This line establishes a connection to the MySQL database using the provided URL, username, and password.

### 11. Database Operations:
// Display existing employee data
showData(stmt);
// Insert new employee data
insertData(stmt);
// Display updated employee data
showData(stmt);
// Delete employee data
deleteData(stmt);
// Display updated employee data
showData(stmt);
// Update employee data
updateData(stmt);
// Display final updated employee data
showData(stmt);

- **Explanation:** 
  - These lines execute various database operations, such as displaying, inserting, deleting, and updating employee data.

### 12. Exception Handling:
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
} finally {
    scanner.close();
}

- **Explanation:** 
  - The `catch` block handles any exceptions that might occur during the execution of the program and prints an error message.
  - The `finally` block ensures that the `Scanner` is closed to prevent resource leaks.

### Conclusion:
This Java program provides a simple yet functional interface for managing employee data in a MySQL database. 
It demonstrates the use of JDBC for database connectivity and includes methods for displaying, inserting, deleting, and updating records. 
The code is organized, and comments provide clarity on the purpose of each section. Additionally, the program handles user input and exceptions gracefully.
