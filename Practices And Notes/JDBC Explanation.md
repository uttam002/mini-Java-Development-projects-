***What is JDBC? List out different types of JDBC driver and explain each.***

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is an API (Application Programming Interface) that allows Java programs to interact with databases. It provides a standardized way for Java applications to execute SQL queries, retrieve and manipulate data from relational databases.

Key features and concepts of JDBC include:

1. **Connection:** JDBC facilitates establishing a connection between a Java application and a database. This connection is typically initiated using a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) string that specifies the database location, username, password, and other connection parameters.

2. **Statement:** JDBC supports executing SQL statements against the database. There are three types of statements: `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, and `CallableStatement`. `Statement` is used for executing static SQL queries, `PreparedStatement` is used for executing parameterized SQL queries, and `CallableStatement` is used for executing stored procedures.

3. **ResultSet:** JDBC provides the `ResultSet` interface for fetching and navigating through the results returned by SQL queries. It allows iterating over the query results row by row, accessing individual columns, and performing operations such as insertions, deletions, and updates.

4. **Transactions:** JDBC supports transaction management, allowing developers to group multiple database operations into a single unit of work. Transactions ensure data consistency and integrity by enforcing ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.

5. **Exception Handling:** JDBC defines a set of exceptions that are thrown when errors occur during database operations. Proper exception handling is essential for robust error recovery and fault tolerance in JDBC applications.

6. **Metadata:** JDBC provides metadata facilities for retrieving information about the database schema, such as table names, column names, data types, and constraints. Metadata queries can be used for dynamic database introspection and schema manipulation.

7. **Driver Manager:** JDBC employs a Driver Manager to manage and load JDBC drivers dynamically. JDBC drivers are responsible for establishing connections to specific database systems and translating JDBC calls into native database operations.

Overall, JDBC serves as a bridge between Java applications and relational databases, enabling seamless integration of database functionality into Java programs. It offers a powerful and flexible framework for database access and manipulation, making it an essential tool for Java developers working with data-driven applications.

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is an API (Application Programming Interface) that enables Java applications to interact with databases. It provides a set of Java classes and interfaces for executing SQL statements, accessing and manipulating data from relational databases.

Different types of JDBC drivers are:

1. **Type 1: JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver:**
   - This driver translates JDBC method calls into ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) function calls. It requires the ODBC driver to be installed on the client machine.
   - It provides connectivity to any database that supports ODBC, regardless of the database.
   - However, it may incur a performance overhead due to the translation layer and dependence on ODBC.
   - Example: `sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver`

2. **Type 2: Native-API Driver:**
   - Also known as the Native Driver or partially Java driver.
   - It uses a database-specific native client library to communicate with the database.
   - The native client library talks to the database server directly, bypassing the need for ODBC.
   - It offers better performance than the JDBC-ODBC bridge as it eliminates the ODBC layer.
   - Example: Oracle's OCI (Oracle Call Interface) driver.

3. **Type 3: Network Protocol Driver (Middleware Driver):**
   - This driver translates JDBC calls into a database-independent network protocol.
   - It requires a middle-tier server to act as a mediator between the client application and the database server.
   - The middle-tier server converts JDBC calls into the database-specific protocol.
   - Provides database independence and can access multiple databases through the same driver.
   - Example: JDBC-Net pure Java driver provided by Oracle.

4. **Type 4: Thin Driver (Direct to Database Pure Java Driver):**
   - Also known as the Pure Java driver.
   - It communicates directly with the database server using a vendor-specific network protocol.
   - It does not require any native libraries or middleware servers.
   - Offers better performance than other types of drivers because it eliminates the need for additional translation layers.
   - Suitable for web applications and environments where client installations are not feasible.
   - Example: Oracle Thin driver.

Each type of JDBC driver has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of driver depends on factors such as performance requirements, database platform, deployment environment, and application architecture.
