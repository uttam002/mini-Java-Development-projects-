Certainly! Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Importing Required Packages**:
   ```java
   import java.net.*;
   ```
   This line imports the `java.net` package, which contains classes for networking operations, including the `URL` class.

2. **Defining the Class**:
   ```java
   public class URLExample {
   ```
   This line defines a class named `URLExample`.

3. **Defining the Main Method**:
   ```java
   public static void main(String[] args) {
   ```
   This line defines the main method, which serves as the entry point for the Java program.

4. **Try-Catch Block**:
   ```java
   try {
   ```
   This indicates the start of a block where exceptions are handled. Code inside the try block is monitored for exceptions.

5. **Creating a URL Object**:
   ```java
   URL url = new URL("https://www.example.com/index.html?query=java");
   ```
   Here, a `URL` object named `url` is created, representing the URL "https://www.example.com/index.html?query=java".

6. **Extracting URL Components**:
   ```java
   System.out.println("Protocol: " + url.getProtocol());
   System.out.println("Host: " + url.getHost());
   System.out.println("Port: " + url.getPort());
   System.out.println("Path: " + url.getPath());
   System.out.println("Query: " + url.getQuery());
   System.out.println("File: " + url.getFile());
   ```
   These lines extract various components of the URL using methods provided by the `URL` class and print them to the console.

7. **Opening a Connection to the URL**:
   ```java
   HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
   connection.setRequestMethod("GET");
   ```
   Here, a connection to the URL is opened using `HttpURLConnection`. The request method is set to "GET" to retrieve data from the URL.

8. **Getting Response Code**:
   ```java
   int responseCode = connection.getResponseCode();
   System.out.println("Response Code: " + responseCode);
   ```
   This retrieves the HTTP response code from the connection, indicating the status of the request (e.g., success, error).

9. **Reading Content from URL**:
   ```java
   BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream()));
   String line;
   StringBuffer content = new StringBuffer();
   while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
       content.append(line);
   }
   reader.close();
   ```
   Here, the content of the webpage is read using a `BufferedReader`, and each line is appended to a `StringBuffer`.

10. **Displaying Content**:
    ```java
    System.out.println("Content of the webpage:");
    System.out.println(content.toString());
    ```
    The content of the webpage is printed to the console.

11. **Disconnecting the Connection**:
    ```java
    connection.disconnect();
    ```
    This line disconnects the connection to the URL.

12. **Handling Exceptions**:
    ```java
    } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
        System.out.println("Invalid URL: " + e.getMessage());
    } catch (IOException e) {
        System.out.println("Error reading from URL: " + e.getMessage());
    }
    ```
    This block catches any exceptions that occur during the execution of the code. If the URL is invalid (`MalformedURLException`), or if there is an error reading from the URL (`IOException`), an error message is printed to the console.

This code demonstrates how to use the `URL` class in Java to extract components from a URL, open a connection to it, retrieve content, and handle exceptions that may arise during the process.
